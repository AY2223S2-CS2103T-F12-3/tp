* This is **a project for Software Engineering (SE) students in the module CS2103T**.<br>
* It is named `AddressBook Neo` and is designed to help NUS social butterflies with many contacts and multiple platforms of communication to organize their school life
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
