### Project: AddressBook Neo

AddressBook Neo is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a 'Select Command' that displays the details of the corresponding index (PR [#138](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/pull/138))
  * Justification: Using the mouse to click on contacts to display requires users' hands to leave the keyboard which may slow down the process, thus having a select functionality
    in the command line prevents this.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=rachtan27&breakdown=true)

* **Project management**:
  * `to be added soon`
